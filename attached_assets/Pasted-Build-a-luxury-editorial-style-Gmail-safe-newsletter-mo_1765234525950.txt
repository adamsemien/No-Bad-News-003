**Editor’s Note - Adam’s Corner**

I’ve built companies, helped shape brands, and thrown more nights than I can count. But the only thing that’s ever really driven me is the moment someone feels something because of a room, a song, a dish, or a person they just met. Goosebumps have always been the goal.

I love beautiful things. I love music, food, people in their element. I love discovering something special and sharing it with the right person at the right time - that look on their face when you know you just showed them something they didn’t know they needed.

That’s why Chloe and I built No Bad Company. And this - No Bad News - is the extension of that instinct. A weekly drop of what I’m paying attention to, who I’m learning from, and the details I think are worth your time.

I’m not here to perform. I’m here to share. Read it. Forward it. Or reply and tell me what I should be chasing next.

**No Bad Food - My Family Gumbo**

I come from a Cajun family of cooks and restaurant owners. My family ran a BBQ spot in Houston called Lockwood Inn from 1928 to 1996 before it burned down. My grandmother was a Cajun caterer. My mom made the best gumbo I’ve ever had - and everyone who’s ever eaten it agrees.

This is the gumbo I grew up on. The one people still ask about years later. The one that shows up at holidays, late nights, and when it really matters.

I finally filmed it.

* 🎥 Full video: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TftOIelM-j8](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TftOIelM-j8)
* 📝 Written recipe + ingredients: [RECIPE LINK HERE]

This isn’t a “twist” on gumbo. It’s the real thing. Take your time with it.

**No Bad Hosting**

The fastest way to level up any conversation at a party is to stop asking, “What do you do?”

Try this instead:

* “What keeps you busy during the day?”

It’s broader. It’s softer. And it lets people answer however they want - career, creative projects, family, fitness, building something on the side. The energy shifts instantly.

Work can feel like a label.
Busy feels like a story.

**Cocktail Bites**

They lit the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree this week - star and all. That star on top?

* It weighs over 900 pounds
* It’s covered in millions of crystals
* And it’s custom-engineered so the wind doesn’t rip it off the building

It looks effortless.
It absolutely is not.

## ✅ NO BAD MUSIC (WITH LIVE IMAGE)

**No Bad Music - Frank Ocean, Again**

Where the hell are you, Frank?
Seriously. You disappear like this every few years and just leave us hanging.

But this week I went back to “Strawberry Swing” by Frank Ocean off Nostalgia, Ultra, and yeah… it still hits. Hard.

* Mood: reflective, wide-open, slightly unraveled

**No Bad Design**

This week’s obsession is Nikolas Bentel Studio.

He pulls digital objects into the real world - desktop folders, UI windows, system icons - and turns them into physical products. Laptop cases that look like software panels. Bags that feel like pop-ups.

It works because it does three things at once:

* Feels stupid simple
* Looks insanely clean
* Quietly messes with your sense of reality

It doesn’t try to feel futuristic.
It just shifts the world one notch sideways.
