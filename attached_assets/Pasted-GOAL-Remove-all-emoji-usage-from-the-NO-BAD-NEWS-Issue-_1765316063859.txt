GOAL: Remove all emoji usage from the NO BAD NEWS Issue 001 newsletter and replace their function with refined, mature editorial styling. This must feel like a real publication, not AI-generated or playful.

DO NOT change:

* Brand colors
* Fonts
* Layout width
* Section order
* Spacing system
* Images
* Buttons
* Existing copy (only remove emojis and replace their visual role)

---

1. GLOBAL EMOJI REMOVAL

* Remove 100% of emojis from:

  * TL;DR section
  * Section headers
  * Bulleted lists
  * Inline body copy
* Do not leave gaps where emojis were - replace their visual purpose deliberately.

---

2. TL;DR REPLACEMENT STYLE (VERY IMPORTANT)
   Replace each emoji bullet with:

* A refined typographic bullet (•)
* Or a thin horizontal rule between items
* Or small muted uppercase labels

Example transformation:
OLD:
🍲 Gumbo recipe on video
🕯 Hosting move for better conversation

NEW OPTIONS (choose ONE consistent style):
• Gumbo recipe on video
• Hosting move for better conversation

OR

FOOD - Gumbo recipe on video
HOSTING - A move for better conversation

Must feel:
Editorial. Calm. Confident. Not cute.

---

3. SECTION HEADERS

* Remove any decorative emoji next to section titles
* Rely only on:

  * Typography
  * Spacing
  * Thin dividers
  * Micro-description lines

---

4. BULLETED LISTS (No Bad Tips, Design, etc.)
   Replace emoji bullets with:

* Clean dot bullets (•)
* Light en-dash bullets (–)
* Or subtle numbered lists when appropriate

Never use icons or symbols that feel “app-like.”

---

5. OVERALL TONE ADJUSTMENT
   After emoji removal, apply:

* Slight increase in line-height in TL;DR for breathability
* Slight increase in spacing between bullet items
* Slight decrease in visual noise overall

The page should now feel:
Quiet. Intentional. Grown.

---

6. FINAL QUALITY BAR
   This version of the newsletter should feel like it could live next to:

* The New Yorker
* Kinfolk
* GQ Longform
* A24 editorial
* Cereal Magazine

No emoji should remain anywhere on the page.

OUTPUT:
Return the updated desktop email mock with all emojis removed and replaced by refined editorial styling.
