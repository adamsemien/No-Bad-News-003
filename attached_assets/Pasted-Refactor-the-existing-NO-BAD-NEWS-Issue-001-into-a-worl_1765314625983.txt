Refactor the existing **NO BAD NEWS – Issue 001** into a **world-class luxury editorial EMAIL newsletter**.

This is a **DESKTOP-FIRST EMAIL DESIGN** (not a website).
It must render perfectly inside **Gmail + ActiveCampaign**.

This is a **content replacement + layout polish + spacing + editorial rhythm pass**.
Do NOT redesign the brand. Do NOT alter the core visual identity.

* Centered on page
* No JavaScript

## 5. SECTION MICRO-DESCRIPTIONS

Place these one-line descriptors directly under each section title in a lighter, muted style:

* **No Bad Food** – “Recipes, restaurants, and things worth cooking slow.”
* **No Bad Hosting** – “Moves that make rooms feel better.”
* **No Bad Tips** – “Small insights you can casually drop.”
* **No Bad Music** – “One song. One mood. No skips.”

* **No Bad Company** – “Beautiful people from our community.”
* **No Bad Plans** – “One thing actually worth leaving the house for.”

These should feel editorial and restrained.

## 6. IMAGE RULES (UPDATED – VERY IMPORTANT)

Exactly THREE sections include images:
