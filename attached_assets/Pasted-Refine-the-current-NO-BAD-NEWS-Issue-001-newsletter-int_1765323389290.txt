Refine the current **NO BAD NEWS – Issue 001** newsletter into a **premium luxury editorial email**.

This is a **pure elevation + sequencing + hierarchy pass ONLY**.
❌ Do NOT change brand colors
❌ Do NOT change fonts
❌ Do NOT redesign the layout system
❌ Do NOT introduce new components or grids

✅ You MAY re-order existing sections
✅ You MAY refine spacing, hierarchy, and emphasis
✅ You MAY style sponsorship placeholders more clearly

## 1. NEW EDITORIAL SECTION ORDER (LOCKED)

Reorder the newsletter into THIS EXACT FLOW:

1. Masthead
2. TL;DR
3. Editor’s Note – Adam’s Corner
4. **No Bad Company (FEATURE – MOVE HERE)**
5. No Bad Food
6. No Bad Hosting
7. No Bad Tips
8. No Bad Music
9. No Bad Design
10. No Bad Plans
11. Today’s Thought
12. Final CTA + Footer

No Bad Company MUST visually feel like the editorial centerpiece of the issue.

---

## 2. MAKE “NO BAD COMPANY” THE FEATURE

* Add a thin divider ABOVE it
* Add more vertical space above and below than any other section
* Maintain the image
* Make this section feel like the *soul* of the issue

---

## 3. SPONSORSHIP PLACEMENT (CLEAR BUT LUXURY)

Add sponsorship placeholders in BOTH:

* After **No Bad Food**
* Inside **No Bad Plans**

Format BOTH using:

* A thin divider above
* Centered, small italic text:
  “Presented with support from a future brand partner.”
* Slightly muted opacity
* Should feel **luxury and intentional**, not like dead space

---

## 4. TODAY’S THOUGHT (REPLACE COPY + STYLE AS A POETIC CLOSE)

Replace Today’s Thought text with this exact copy:

“One great conversation can change your life.
We just make sure you’re in the right room.”

Style rules:

* Increase space above this section
* Slightly smaller and lighter type
* It should feel like a closing note, not a CTA

---

## 5. INCREASE NEGATIVE SPACE (GLOBAL)

* Add ~12–15% more vertical spacing between all major sections
* Increase spacing between paragraphs in Editor’s Note
* Add more breathing room above and below all images

---

## 6. CTA REFINEMENT

* Keep existing red color
* Increase internal padding slightly
* Reduce visual dominance so buttons feel like quiet invitations, not promotions

---

## 7. OVERALL FEEL TARGET

The final result must feel:

* Editorial
* Calm
* Confident
* Human
* Timeless
* Comparable to Kinfolk, GQ, or Vogue editorial emails

---

DO NOT alter copy outside of Today’s Thought.
DO NOT reintroduce emojis or icons.
DO NOT change brand colors.
DO NOT add decorative UI.

This is a **luxury editorial sequencing and polish pass only.**
