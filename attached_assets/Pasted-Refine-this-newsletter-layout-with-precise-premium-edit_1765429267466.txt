Refine this newsletter layout with precise, premium editorial polish.
Do NOT change fonts, colors, tone, copy, or general structure.
Only apply spacing, hierarchy, and micro-typography improvements.

GLOBAL TYPOGRAPHY & RHYTHM

Standardize vertical spacing between all major sections to a consistent value.
Use a rhythm that visually matches high-end editorial sites (NYT Magazine, Kinfolk, Gentlewoman).

Reduce excess white gaps between sections, especially below images, headers, and CTAs.

Increase line-height for body text slightly for readability.

Ensure all red micro-tags have consistent top and bottom spacing.

MASTHEAD

Add a subtle visual grounding element beneath the “NO BAD NEWS” masthead:
a thin 1px horizontal rule or a minimal decorative line.

Slightly reduce the space between the masthead, tagline, and the mini-photo block.

Ensure the “For the stories that need to be told.” line sits cleanly within the masthead block with ~20% tighter spacing.

SECTION HEADERS

For “Editor’s Note,” “No Bad Company,” “No Bad Food,” “No Bad Hosting,” “No Bad Tips,” “No Bad Music,” “No Bad Design,” “No Bad Plans”:

Increase font size by 5–8%.

Add slight letter spacing for elegance.

Ensure each header has consistent spacing above and below across the full page.

Unify header weight so they look part of one system.

IMAGES

Ensure all images have consistent margin above and below (slightly reduced from current).

Maintain rounded corners and aspect ratios (if present).

Keep all images centered relative to their sections.

CTAs

Standardize CTA button width and spacing.

Add consistent vertical padding above and below CTAs, especially the mid-page red buttons.

Move the final CTA (“JOIN THE RED LIST”) up slightly so it does not collide with the footer.

FOOTER

Add extra top padding to create clean separation from the final CTA.

Ensure the footer bar color remains unchanged but is visually balanced with the rest of the layout.

Remove any accidental margin collapse causing visual compression at the bottom.

OVERALL FEEL

The entire page should read top-to-bottom with smooth, even editorial flow.

No abrupt spacing changes.

No unusually large blocks of white space.

Maintain the luxury–minimalist–editorial aesthetic of No Bad Company.

Output the fully refined HTML/CSS layout with these adjustments applied.
