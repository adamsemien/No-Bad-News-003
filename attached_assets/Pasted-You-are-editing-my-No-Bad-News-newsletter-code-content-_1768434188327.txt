SECTION: "Editor’s Note"
REPLACE BODY WITH THIS LOCKED COPY:

Every year the holidays come and go. A new year starts, and we’re given this quiet moment to reset - or at least reconsider what we want to focus on. Some people do Dry January. Others commit to workouts. For me, this year has been about something a little less obvious.

I’ve never been big on social media. I don’t share much. I repost when I’m tagged, but for the most part, I’ve always stayed quiet. For a long time, I told myself that building a personal brand felt vain - unnecessary. Lately, I’ve realized that was an easy excuse.

When your life and work revolve around creating experiences and connecting people, choosing not to share your perspective isn’t humility - it’s absence. And absence doesn’t make anything better. Staying quiet doesn’t mean you don’t have a point of view. It just means you’re opting out of contributing it.

I’m not saying I’m always right. I’m not saying the world is better if everyone listens to me. I am saying I now know my opinions matter - and there’s nothing wrong with sharing your voice when it’s honest and considered. It’s a piece of you. Why hide it?

Something I’ve been reminding myself lately: you’re not afraid of failure - you’re afraid of being seen failing. That’s ego. We want to look effortless, refined, composed. But the people who actually get better are the ones willing to look a little foolish in pursuit of something real.

New year. Same me. Slightly louder.

The fastest way to make someone feel welcome is simple:
make sure they have a drink.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve walked into a friend’s house and wasn’t offered anything. No cocktail. No water. Nothing. It’s wild.

I host friends at my place all the time - part of why Yellow House became what it is - and I always offer a drink. Especially with new guests. If someone asks what I have, I don’t list options. I just ask, “What do you like?” and surprise them with something simple.

If someone doesn’t drink, no problem - want a joint?
If you want a mocktail, I’ve got you there too.

The point isn’t alcohol. It’s intention.

You don’t need to be a mixologist. Anyone can make a good drink. Learn a few basics, get a decent shaker, and suddenly people feel taken care of. A solid Old Fashioned goes a long way. Short on time? Batch margaritas. Just use fresh juice if you can - it makes a world of difference.

Good hosting isn’t about impressing people.
It’s about making them feel settled the moment they arrive.

If you want to learn the fundamentals, Cocktail Codex is a great place to start.

SECTION: "No Bad Music" (Newsletter 003)
REPLACE BODY WITH THIS LOCKED COPY:

I miss the old Kanye.

If you’re close to Chloe or me, you know we both love Kanye West. And before anyone jumps there - I’m not talking politics or headlines or anything else he’s done or said. I’m talking strictly about the music.

I wouldn’t let him babysit my kids (that I don’t have), but he’s undeniably one of the greatest creative geniuses of our generation.

There’s one project we keep coming back to: Runaway - the long-form film that accompanies My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. It’s about 30 minutes, stitched together from the album, and it’s still one of the most ambitious music projects ever released.

Two moments always get me.
One - the scene where he’s playing “Power” live on the MPC. It’s raw and physical, a reminder that this all starts with hands on a machine.
Two - the dinner scene during “Runaway,” where he’s wearing that tuxedo jacket. I don’t know why, but I’ve wanted that jacket in my arsenal ever since.

The visuals are cohesive. The mixes are unreal. But more than anything, Kanye tells a story here - one that we find ourselves coming back to, year after year.

Chloe and I revisit this at least once a year, and every time we do, something new clicks. A transition. A choice. A feeling that lands differently depending on where we’re at.

Who would I be not to share?

Sit with it. No multitasking.


SECTION: "No Bad Hosting" (Newsletter 003)
REPLACE BODY WITH THIS LOCKED COPY:

A great host knows how to read a room. They notice who hasn’t been pulled in yet and make introductions before things feel awkward.

But not every room has someone doing that work.

So here’s a move I’ve learned to trust - at work events, parties, anywhere you’re walking into a room and don’t quite know where to land.

If you’re unsure who to talk to, look for two people already in conversation.

It’s the easiest place to enter without forcing anything. There’s already energy there. You’re not interrupting a moment or trying to carry a conversation on your own - you’re joining something that’s already moving.

I’ve met some of my best collaborators and friends this way. Not by working the room, but by paying attention to it.

Good hosting isn’t about being the loudest or the smoothest person there.
It’s about knowing how to step in - and when to let things unfold naturally.


FINAL CHECKS:
