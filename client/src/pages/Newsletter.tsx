              Every year the holidays come and go. A new year starts, and we’re given this quiet moment to reset - or at least reconsider what we want to focus on. Some people do Dry January. Others commit to workouts. For me, this year has been about something a little less obvious.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              I’ve never been big on social media. I don’t share much. I repost when I’m tagged, but for the most part, I’ve always stayed quiet. For a long time, I told myself that building a personal brand felt vain - unnecessary. Lately, I’ve realized that was an easy excuse.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              When your life and work revolve around creating experiences and connecting people, choosing not to share your perspective isn’t humility - it’s absence. And absence doesn’t make anything better. Staying quiet doesn’t mean you don’t have a point of view. It just means you’re opting out of contributing it.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              I’m not saying I’m always right. I’m not saying the world is better if everyone listens to me. I am saying I now know my opinions matter - and there’s nothing wrong with sharing your voice when it’s honest and considered. It’s a piece of you. Why hide it?
            </p>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Something I’ve been reminding myself lately: you’re not afraid of failure - you’re afraid of being seen failing. That’s ego. We want to look effortless, refined, composed. But the people who actually get better are the ones willing to look a little foolish in pursuit of something real.
            </p>

            We’ve been doing this together since high school - Houston suburb kids who watched our neighborhood quietly turn out giants (<span className="italic">shoutout</span> Mo City - 281). Somewhere between then and now, we learned that hosting isn’t about throwing parties. It’s about building rooms where people feel like themselves again.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            The Yellow House came later. So did the careers. Chloe built her dream home in East Austin, TX - designed for gathering, and a reputation guiding people through life-changing decisions in real estate. I built rooms through culture - my prior events brand Keep It Quiet, and my hospitality foray into Devil May Care. What never changed was the instinct to bring the right people together on purpose.

            No Bad Company is for the stories waiting to be told. For the leaders, the creators, the endlessly curious. For the builders. We believe there’s more than enough room at the top. And it’s better when we climb together.

            Anthony Bourdain is my favorite writer.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Not because he used big words or tried to sound smart — but because he didn’t. He had this rare ability to make you feel every word, every place he visited, every late night, every bad decision, every perfect meal. Nothing ever felt performative. It felt lived.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Bourdain understood kitchens. He understood cooks. He understood what it’s like to grind, to mess up, to rebuild, to find meaning in unlikely places. You can feel that in his writing. It’s simple, direct, and incredibly effective. Emotional without trying to be.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            If you haven’t read Kitchen Confidential, I can’t recommend it enough — especially the audiobook, which he narrates himself. Hearing him tell those stories in his own voice makes it hit differently. It’s raw, funny, honest, and still somehow comforting.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            He left a lasting mark on food, travel, and culture — and an incredible legacy. I still haven’t been able to bring myself to watch Roadrunner. It feels like the end of a chapter I’m not ready to close.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            I recently gave Kitchen Confidential to my buddy Mitch and he texted me a few days later saying it was addicting. That checks out.

            A great host knows how to read a room. They notice who hasn’t been pulled in yet and make introductions before things feel awkward.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            But not every room has someone doing that work.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            So here’s a move I’ve learned to trust - at work events, parties, anywhere you’re walking into a room and don’t quite know where to land.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            If you’re unsure who to talk to, look for two people already in conversation.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            It’s the easiest place to enter without forcing anything. There’s already energy there. You’re not interrupting a moment or trying to carry a conversation on your own - you’re joining something that’s already moving.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            I’ve met some of my best collaborators and friends this way. Not by working the room, but by paying attention to it.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Good hosting isn’t about being the loudest or the smoothest person there.
            It’s about knowing how to step in - and when to let things unfold naturally.

            I miss the old Kanye.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            If you’re close to Chloe or me, you know we both love Kanye West. And before anyone jumps there - I’m not talking politics or headlines or anything else he’s done or said. I’m talking strictly about the music.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            I wouldn’t let him babysit my kids (that I don’t have), but he’s undeniably one of the greatest creative geniuses of our generation.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            There’s one project we keep coming back to: Runaway - the long-form film that accompanies My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. It’s about 30 minutes, stitched together from the album, and it’s still one of the most ambitious music projects ever released.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Two moments always get me.<br/>
            One - the scene where he’s playing “Power” live on the MPC. It’s raw and physical, a reminder that this all starts with hands on a machine.<br/>
            Two - the dinner scene during “Runaway,” where he’s wearing that tuxedo jacket. I don’t know why, but I’ve wanted that jacket in my arsenal ever since.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            The visuals are cohesive. The mixes are unreal. But more than anything, Kanye tells a story here - one that we find ourselves coming back to, year after year.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Chloe and I revisit this at least once a year, and every time we do, something new clicks. A transition. A choice. A feeling that lands differently depending on where we’re at.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Who would I be not to share?
